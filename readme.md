#PD Tools/Projects

#What's this mess about?

Pure Data is a visual audio-programming language designed
at creating interactive applications. It works a lot like
Max/MSP by Cycling '74, and was made by the same guy who did
make Max.

#Why Can't I Read this Garbage?

It's a *visual* language, meaning it can only be *viewed*.
You need the PureData application set to view PD scripts 
properly.

#Where do I get PD?

Get it [here](http://puredata.info/)

#Vanilla or Extended?

Extended contains a ton of extra libraries that make 
Pure Data a lot cooler. Get Extended.

#What's this Repo for?

It's meant to store a lot of my PD scripts/applications. 
It's hard to keep stuff documented in it for Github, but 
I'll try to add readme notes for important projects.
