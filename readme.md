#PD Tools/Projects

Pure Data is a visual audio-programming language designed
at creating interactive applications. It works a lot like
Max/MSP by Cycling '74, and was made by the same guy who did
make Max.

#Why Can't I Read this Garbage?

It's a *visual* language, meaning it can only be *viewed*.
You need the PureData application set to view PD scripts 
properly.

#Where do I get PD?

Get it [here](http://puredata.info/)

#Vanilla or Extended?

Extended contains a ton of extra libraries that make 
Pure Data a lot cooler. Get Extended.

#What's this Repo for?

Basically to keep my scripts safely stored somewhere! Also if someone wants to mull through the scripts to find something they like.
